Forms of intercast relation


    forest
        - An ordered set of trees.
        - The order of trees is determined by descendant weight at their roots.
    goal forest
        / A type of waysource forest.
    intercast network
        - A system of interconnected waycasts and waycasters.
    tree
        - An ordered, cyclic in-tree.
            / Re in-tree, aka anti-arborescence.
        - The order of sibling nodes is determined by descendant weight.
        - The tree is cyclic (potentially) in that the root comprises either a node or cycle.
    way-file forest
        / A type of waysource forest.
    waysource forest
        - A goal forest or way-file forest.
        - Visitors will typically orient on the basis of waysource popularity as measured by actual use.
            - Accordingly the measure of the mass of a tree node (from which descendant weights
              are calculated) is the number of waycasts whose way models include the waysource
              (goal or way file) represented by the node.
