Forms of intercast relation


    forest
        - An ordered set of trees of a particular edge type.
        - Trees are ordered by basal vote count.

    tree
        - An ordered tree of waycast nodes joined by intercast edges of a particular type.
        - The form is actually that of a Votorola-style psuedo tree.
            - Each tree has a base which is either a root or node cycle.
            - Each edge counts as a cascading vote, the cumulative sums of which order the child nodes.
